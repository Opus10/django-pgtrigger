# django-pgtrigger

`django-pgtrigger` helps you write [Postgres triggers](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/sql-createtrigger.html) for your Django models.

## Why should I use triggers?

Triggers can solve a variety of complex problems more reliably, performantly, and succinctly than application code.
For example,

* Protecting operations on rows or columns (`pgtrigger.Protect`).
* Making read-only models or fields (`pgtrigger.ReadOnly`).
* Soft-deleting models (`pgtrigger.SoftDelete`).
* Snapshotting and tracking model changes ([django-pghistory](https://django-pghistory.readthedocs.io/)).
* Enforcing field transitions (`pgtrigger.FSM`).
* Keeping a search vector updated for full-text search (`pgtrigger.UpdateSearchVector`).
* Building official interfaces (e.g. enforcing use of `User.objects.create_user` and not `User.objects.create`).
* Versioning models, mirroring fields, computing unique model hashes, and the list goes on...

All of these examples require no overridden methods, no base models, and no signal handling.

## Quick start

Install `django-pgtrigger` with `pip3 install django-pgtrigger` and add `pgtrigger` to `settings.INSTALLED_APPS`.

`pgtrigger.Trigger` objects are added to `triggers` in model `Meta`. `django-pgtrigger` comes with several trigger classes, such as `pgtrigger.Protect`. In the following, we're protecting the model from being deleted:

```python
import pgtrigger

class ProtectedModel(models.Model):
    """This model cannot be deleted!"""

    class Meta:
        triggers = [
            pgtrigger.Protect(name="protect_deletes", operation=pgtrigger.Delete)
        ]
```

When migrations are created and executed, `ProtectedModel` will raise an exception anytime a deletion is attempted.

Let's extend this example further and only protect deletions on inactive objects. In this example, the trigger conditionally runs when the row being deleted (the `OLD` row in trigger terminology) is still active:

```python
import pgtrigger

class ProtectedModel(models.Model):
    """Active object cannot be deleted!"""
    is_active = models.BooleanField(default=True)

    class Meta:
        triggers = [
            pgtrigger.Protect(
                name="protect_deletes",
                operation=pgtrigger.Delete,
                condition=pgtrigger.Q(old__is_active=True)
            )
        ]
```

`django-pgtrigger` uses `pgtrigger.Q` and `pgtrigger.F` objects to conditionally execute triggers based on the `OLD` and `NEW` rows. Combining these Django idioms with `pgtrigger.Trigger` objects can solve a wide variety of problems without ever writing SQL. Users, however, can still use raw SQL for complex cases.

Triggers are installed like other database objects. Run `python manage.py makemigrations` and `python manage.py migrate` to install triggers.

If triggers are new to you, don't worry. The [pgtrigger docs](https://django-pgtrigger.readthedocs.io/) cover triggers in more detail and provide many examples.

## Compatibility

`django-pgtrigger` is compatible with Python 3.8 - 3.12, Django 3.2 - 4.2, Psycopg 2 - 3, and Postgres 12 - 16.

## Installation

Install `django-pgtrigger` with:

    pip3 install django-pgtrigger

After this, add `pgtrigger` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` setting of your Django project.

## Other Material

After you've read the docs, check out [this tutorial](https://wesleykendall.github.io/django-pgtrigger-tutorial/) with interactive examples from a Django meetup talk.

The [DjangoCon 2021 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Tte3d4JjxCk) also breaks down triggers and shows several examples.
